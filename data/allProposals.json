There are no marked crosswalks for a 9 block stretch (between 34th Ave NE and 25th Ave NE), despite an active retail area between 28th and 30th Ave. NE. This is a wide road with cars parked only intermittently, leading to fast traffic. Drivers rarely stop for people to cross the street. It has been the spot of at least one collision leading to serious injuries for a woman crossing the street (http:\/\/www.ravennabryant.org\/2013\/11\/hit-and-run-on-ne-55th\/).

Crossing anywhere this stretch of NE 55th St. is a challenge, but this proposal focuses on improving the crossing at 30th Ave. NE. This is an important intersection because it is halfway between lights (at 25th and 35th Ave. NE). It is located in a retail core.

This is on the edge of the cemetery, and is a prime corridor for people walking and biking to Bryant or beyond from U Village and the Burke Gilman trail. Parked cars make it challenging for people driving to see those waiting to cross, especially at the Z-shaped intersection of 30th Ave. NE, where people are attempting to cross from a sidewalk ramp hidden in between cars, rather than at a street corner. There are multiple preschools and child-centered businesses on or adjacent to NE 55th, and so parents commonly need to park on 55th and cross this busy street with young children.

If this were implemented with a lower cost paint\/barrier curb bulb, a design like teacups might be painted on to incorporate local character at the \"Queen Mary Crossing.\"     2) Marked Crosswalks  Because many, especially those biking, cross on the east side of the intersection, two painted crosswalks at both the east and west side where 55th and 30th intersect are key to making this crossing successful.     3) Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon  A RRFB that could be triggered from the sidewalk or by a person on a bike (heading north on 30th) could add another element of visibility.

Despite this, the intersection has no traffic signal and not even marked crosswalks to assist people crossing 2-3 lanes of busy, often non-local traffic. After living on this corner for four years, I've witnessed multiple vehicle accidents due to the poor markings of this intersection, as well as several near-accidents involving pedestrians attempting to cross. Despite having no crosswalk or stop signs, vehicles frequently stop their lane of traffic to allow pedestrians to cross, creating a high potential for accidents for both vehicles behind them due to the unexpected stoppage, and for pedestrians who may not realize that the other lanes have not stopped to allow them to cross safely.","idea":"Marked crosswalks across 1st Ave N at Thomas St, potentially with flashing beacons to increase visibility particularly at night, would indicate to vehicles that they should be on the lookout for pedestrians crossing at this busy intersection. This would increase traffic safety both for vehicles and for pedestrians.","latitude":47.620934,"longitude":-122.355441,"location":"1st Ave N and Thomas St intersection","type":"Crossing Improvements","dept":"SDOT","benefits":"This project would benefit both locals--the residential density of the Uptown\/Lower Queen Anne area is rapidly increasing--and the huge influx of non-residents due to tourist and event destinations in the neighborhood, such as Seattle Center and Key Arena.","dist":7,"neigh":"Uptown"},{"status":"Advance to Further Review","review1":12,"review2":20.0,"avg":16.0,"initial":null,"no":"17-728","combined":null,"title":"Trail Construction in Lower Kinnear Park","need":"There is no permanent walking path between the southwest corner of Lower Kinnear Park to the sidewalk on Elliot Ave. West.

For Location 1) There are a tremendous number of people who shop at Trader Joe's and the surrounding stores. This also connects QA Community Center, QA Pool, Big Howe Park, Little Howe Park, and more.  Shoppers along with children from surrounding daycares, McClure, and families visiting the QA Farmers Market would benefit greatly from this marked crossing, as it would be a visual cue to drivers of the presence and prioritization of pedestrians.  Many families with strollers or young kids cross here.    2)  This is a naturally level East-West walking route between the west side of the hill and east side, with a direct connection to McClure Middle School.  The key is that this route along Crockett St is very flat compared to other east-west streets and has a direct intersection with the businesses centered on 6th Ave W & Crockett.     3) As the SDOT Report 2016-79 refers to it: This crossing would link the north and south side of this stretch of Galer known as the Sweet Street. All of the businesses here support the idea of a painted crossing, including Molly Moons, Top Pot, and Caffe Fiori.  It also connects directly with Kerry Park, Big Howe and the QA Library. Seniors, commuter, school children all cross Galer and this will provide a safe route at the low point in the topography.
